# What Hacker News says
Web Extension: Easly find Hacker News discussions about the page on your current open tab.

## About
Dead-simple web extension that look for discussions on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) via [HN Search API Powered by Algolia](https://hn.algolia.com/api). I hacked togheter this in a few hours because I was unable to find something so simple: This web extension fetch the API only when the popup is clicked and does not run any background script. It also requires minimum permissions (just `activeTab` actually).

## Install
I'm submitting this to Firefox and Chrome stores, links will appear here.

You can also clone this repo and run as an unpacked extension (but losing automatic future updates).

## Changelog
See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
